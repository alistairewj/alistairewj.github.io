Prior to sharing, it is often necessary to remove identifiers such as names, contact details, and dates in order to protect patient privacy. Deidentification, the process of removing identifiers, is challenging, however. High-quality annotated data for developing models is scarce; many target identifiers are highly heterogenous (for example, there are uncountable variations of patient names); and in practice anything less than perfect sensitivity may be considered a failure. Consequently, software for adequately deidentifying clinical data is not widely available. As a result patient data is often withheld when sharing would be beneficial, and identifiable patient data is often divulged when a deidentified version would suffice.In recent years, advances in machine learning methods have led to rapid performance improvements in natural language processing tasks, in particular with the advent of large-scale pretrained language models. In this paper we develop and evaluate an approach for deidentification of clinical notes based on a bidirectional transformer model. We propose human interpretable evaluation measures and demonstrate state of the art performance against modern baseline models. Finally, we highlight current challenges in deidentification, including the absence of clear annotation guidelines, lack of portability of models, and paucity of training data. Code to develop our model is open source and simple to install, allowing for broad reuse.\n","date":1595581200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595581200,"objectID":"87ed3dc3e192e6cd4af632a3528b1aff","permalink":"/talk/2020-mimic-iv-analysis-tutorial/","publishdate":"2020-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-mimic-iv-analysis-tutorial/","section":"talk","summary":"A

number of researcher degrees of freedom that contribute to the performance of a model presents a challenge when seeking to compare reported performance of such models. We review publications that have reported performance of mortality prediction models based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database and attempted to reproduce datasets for 38 experiments corresponding to 28 published studies. In half of the experiments, the sample size we acquired was 25% greater or smaller than the sample size reported. While accurate reproduction of each study cannot be guaranteed, we believe that these results highlight the need for more consistent reporting of model design and methodology to allow performance improvements to be compared.

Over the last decade there has been a significant surge in interest in using these data sources, from simply reusing the standard clinical databases for event prediction or decision support, to including dynamic and patient-specific information into clinical monitoring and prediction problems. However, in most cases, commercial clinical databases have been designed to document clinical activity for reporting, liability, and billing reasons, rather than for developing new algorithms. With increasing excitement surrounding “secondary use of medical records” and “Big Data” analytics, it is important to understand the limitations of current databases and what needs to change in order to enter an era of “precision medicine.” This review article covers many of the issues involved in the collection and preprocessing of critical care data. The three challenges in critical care are considered: compartmentalization, corruption, and complexity. A range of applications addressing these issues are covered, including the modernization of static acuity scoring; online patient tracking; personalized prediction and risk assessment; artifact detection; state estimation; and incorporation of multimodal data sources such as genomic and free text data.","tags":null,"title":"Machine learning and decision support in critical care","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair e johnson","leo anthony celi","jesse raffa","tom pollard","david stone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"a44a28ef933a6792d829178c8274f0da","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2016-external/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.391736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2016-external/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"External Validation Of The Sepsis-3 Guidelines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["somnath bose","ari moskowitz","laleh jalilian","leo a celi","alistair e johnson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"42f6e6bcc40946225d371bcff84be5df","permalink":"/publication/bose-2016-impact/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.380736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bose-2016-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Impact Of Intensive Care Unit Discharge Delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair ew johnson","joachim behar","fernando andreotti","gari d clifford","julien oster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"6a1ec28c40e86e0d59193353e807efde","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2015-multimodal/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.368739Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2015-multimodal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multimodal heart beat detection using signal quality indices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["joachim behar","alistair e johnson","gari d clifford","julien oster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"f5ba1b8cbd481da58f01d2c56663e9d0","permalink":"/publication/behar-2014-comparison/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.326736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/behar-2014-comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of single channel fetal ECG extraction methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["tingting zhu","alistair e johnson","joachim behar","gari d clifford"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"82872d5d94631af82ebf5a6109372ccd","permalink":"/publication/zhu-2014-crowd/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.342741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu-2014-crowd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Crowd-sourced annotation of ECG signals using contextual information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair e johnson","andrew a kramer","gari d clifford"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ca305c5668e9f1c4fdd56411d6cbb2de","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-data/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.352735Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-data/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Data preprocessing and mortality prediction: the Physionet/CinC 2012 challenge revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair e johnson","jonathan burgess","marco af pimentel","david a clifton","j duncan young","peter j watkinson","lionel tarassenko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"17c92c77fd9ddc01e1484fb7d89ed04c","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-physiological/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.362737Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-physiological/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Physiological trajectory of patients pre and post ICU discharge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair e johnson","joachim behar","fernando andreotti","gari d clifford","julien oster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"30542b37cb6692fa30f91d2ddcb5c538","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-r/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T14:32:59.357739Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2014-r/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"R-peak estimation using multimodal lead switching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alistair ew johnson","andrew a kramer","gari d clifford"],"categories":null,"content":" Performance comparison    Data source Score AUROC SMR     Hospitals across the USA (Cerner)*, 2010-2011 OASIS 0.837 0.91 [0.88, 0.94]   \u0026nbsp;
